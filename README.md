# Mechanical Keyboard
Make any keyboard sound like a mechanical keyboard with this python script! I came up with the idea by myself, and it works by playing one of 5 random mechanical keyboard sounds when any key is pressed. It took my 30 minutes to make, and is similar to the program Mechvibes, which I found out about after.
